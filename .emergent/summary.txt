The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of a full-stack application for a scout group. The process started by clarifying initial requirements, then implementing core features such as basic site structure, data recording for branches, and administrator authentication. The AI engineer utilized  for initial code generation of the React frontend and FastAPI backend, demonstrating a rapid MVP development approach. A crucial step was addressing the user's request for administrator management and subsequently, the implementation of image functionality for activities. The AI effectively used  to source images and  for backend validation. The current state reflects an operational foundation with ongoing work on integrating images for activities, showcasing an iterative development cycle guided by direct user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a website for the Ouragan scout group. The site must feature four distinct branches based on age: meute (6-12 years), troupe (12-16 years), compagnie (17-19 years), and clan (20-25 years). Additionally, it needs to include sections for organizational bodies: the group council, group leadership, and general assembly. A core function is to record data for each branch and their activities. The site must also display a pedagogical project accessible to all visitors. Subsequent requirements included implementing administrator authentication to manage the site and integrating activity images for better understanding and aesthetic appeal. The information recorded for branches and activities primarily pertains to names and relevant details.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **FastAPI**: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the frontend.
- **Bcrypt**: Library used for password hashing in authentication.
- **Vision Expert Agent**: Tool for sourcing and providing high-quality images.
- **Supervisor**: Process control system for managing backend and frontend services.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend components, housed within a monorepo-like structure.



**Detailed Directory Structure and Key Files:**

-   : The root directory of the application.
-   : Contains all components related to the FastAPI backend.
    -   : Manages Python dependencies for the backend.  was added here to support user authentication, specifically for password hashing.
    -   : This is the main FastAPI application file. It defines API endpoints, handles database interactions with MongoDB (using  from environment variables), and includes logic for administrator authentication (e.g., creating an admin, checking admin existence) and potentially initial data management for branches and activities. This file was initially set up using .
    -   : Environment variables for the backend, specifically containing .
-   : Houses the React application.
    -   : Manages Node.js dependencies and scripts for the frontend.
    -   : Configuration file for Tailwind CSS, enabling custom styling and utility-first approach.
    -   : PostCSS configuration for processing CSS.
    -   : Environment variables for the frontend, specifically  for API calls.
    -   : Directory for static assets.
    -   : Contains the core React source code.
        -   : The entry point for the React application.
        -   : The main React component where the application's UI structure and routing are defined. It was initially generated with  to provide a functional and aesthetically pleasing base UI using Tailwind CSS. It will interact with the backend via .
        -   : Component-specific styles for , leveraging Tailwind CSS.
        -   : Global styles for the React application.
-   : This file is crucial for the testing workflow, used by the AI engineer to read and update testing instructions and results.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has established the foundational full-stack application using React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. Initial setup was performed using  to create , , and , ensuring a functional and visually appealing base UI with Tailwind CSS.

A significant step was the implementation of administrator authentication on the backend, indicated by the successful installation of  and the Admin already exists message from backend testing. This suggests an endpoint for admin creation or verification is active.

The most recent activity revolves around integrating images for activities. The AI engineer successfully utilized  to source a collection of high-quality scout-related images. Immediately following this, the AI declared its intent to add the image functionality to the activities and performed a successful file edit. This indicates that the current work is focused on coding the necessary backend routes (if needed for image handling/storage) and frontend components to allow for the display of these images within the activity sections of the website. The user's request for images was explicitly aimed at enhancing the site's beauty and allowing visitors to know us even better.
